## <a name="Quick-Start"> Quick Start</a>

This section shows how to discover Thunderboard React Board Kit(s), how to get a sensor value the device, and how to set a value to the device.

### <a name="Quick-Start-1"> Reading the sensor data </a>

This sample code shows how to read the Environmental Sensing data (humidity, temperature, UV index).

```JavaScript
// Create a ThunderboardReact object
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

// Initialize the ThunderboardReact object
thunder.init((error) => {
  // Discover the Thunderboard React Board Kit
  thunder.startDiscovery((device) => {
    console.log('- Found ' + device.localName);
    // Stop the discovery process
    thunder.stopDiscovery();
    // Connect to the found device
    device.connect((error) => {
      console.log('- Connected ' + device.localName);
      // Get the sensored data
      getEnvironmentalSensing(device);
    });
  });
});

// Get the sensored data
function getEnvironmentalSensing(device) {
  device.getEnvironmentalSensing((error, res) => {
    // Show the data
    console.log('- Sensored data:');
    console.log('  - Humidity    : ' + res.humidity + ' %');
    console.log('  - Temperature : ' + res.temperature + ' °C');
    console.log('  - UV Index    : ' + res.uvIndex);
    // Disconnect the device
    device.disconnect(() => {
      console.log('- Disconnected ' + device.localName);
      process.exit();
    });
  });
}
```

This sample code will output the result like this:

```
- Found Thunder React #28932
- Connected Thunder React #28932
- Sensored data:
  - Humidity    : 50.18 %
  - Temperature : 26.65 °C
  - UV Index    : 0
- Disconnected Thunder React #28932
```

### <a name="Quick-Start-2"> Monitoring the sensor data </a>

This sample code shows how to monitor the sensor data incoming from the device. In this code, the orientation of the device is monitored.

```JavaScript
var ThunderboardReact = require('../lib/node-thunderboard-react.js');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

thunder.init((error) => {
  thunder.startDiscovery((device) => {
    console.log('- Found ' + device.localName);
    thunder.stopDiscovery();
    device.connect((error) => {
      console.log('- Connected ' + device.localName);
      startMonitorOrientation(device);
    });
  });
});

// Monitor the sensored data

  // Start to monitor the orientation of the device
  device.startMonitorOrientation((error) => {
    if(error) {
      console.log(error.toString());
      process.exit();
    }
  });

  // Set a listener for orientation events fired on the ThunderboardReactDevice object
  device.on('orientation', (res) => {
    // Show the event data
    console.log('- Orientation:');
    console.log('  - alpha :' + res.alpha + '°');
    console.log('  - beta  :' + res.beta + '°');
    console.log('  - gamma :' + res.gamma + '°');
  });

  // Stop to monitor and disconnect the device in 5 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    device.stopMonitorOrientation((error) => {
      // Disconnect the device
      device.disconnect(() => {
        console.log('- Disconnected ' + device.localName);
        process.exit();
      });
    });
  }, 5000);
}
```

This sample code will output the result like this:

```

### <a name="Quick-Start-3"> Setting data </a>

This sample code shows how to set data to he device. This code turns on and off the two LEDs on the device one after the other every 500 milliseconds.

```JavaScript
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

thunder.init((error) => {
  thunder.startDiscovery((device) => {
    console.log('- Found ' + device.localName);
    thunder.stopDiscovery();
    device.connect((error) => {
      // Turn on/off the LEDs
      turnOnOffLeds(device, true);
    });
  });
});

// Turn on/off the LEDs
function turnOnOffLeds(device, flag) {
  // Send a message for Turning on/off the LEDs
  var status = {'led0': flag, 'led1': !flag};
  device.setLedStatus(status, (error) => {
    // Recall this method in 500 ms
    setTimeout(() => {
      turnOnOffLeds(device, !flag);
    }, 500);
  });
}
```

You will see the device like this:

## <a name="ThunderboardReact-object"> ThunderboardReact object</a>

### <a name="ThunderboardReact-constructor"> Constructor</a>

In order to use the node-thunderboard-react, you have to load the node-thunderboard-react module as follows:

```JavaScript
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
```

You can get an `ThunderboardReact` constructor using the code above. Then you have to create an `ThunderboardReact` object as an instance of the `ThunderboardReact` constructor as follows:

```JavaScript
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();
```

The `ThunderboardReact` constructor takes an argument optionally. It must be a hash object having the properties as follows:

Property | Type   | Required | Description
:--------|:-------|:---------|:-----------
`noble`  | Noble  | option   | a Noble object of the [`noble`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) module

The node-thunderboard-react module uses the [`noble`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) module in order to interact with the Thunderboard React(s) on BLE. If you want to interact other BLE devices using the noble module, you can create an `Noble` object by yourself, then pass it to this module. If you don't specify a `Noble` object for the `noble` property, this module automatically create a `Noble` object internally.

The sample code below shows how to pass a `Nobel` object to the `ThunderboardReact` constructor.

```JavaScript
// Create a Noble object
var noble = require('noble');

// Create a ThunderboardReact object
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact({'noble': noble});
```

### <a name="ThunderboardReact-methods"> Methods</a>

This section describes the methods implemented in the `ThunderboardReact` object.

#### <a name="init-method"> init(*callback*)</a>

This method initializes the `ThunderboardReact` object. You have to initialize the `ThunderboardReact` object immediately after you create it.

The initialization is processed asynchronously. Therefore you have to specify a callback function as the 1st argument of this method.

```JavaScript
// Create a ThunderboardReact object
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

// Initialize the ThunderboardReact object
thunder.init((error) => {
	if(error) { // An error was occurred
    // Do something for the error.
  } else { // The initialization process completed successfully
    // Do something using the ThunderboardReact object.
    // Generally, the discover process is started here.
  }
});
```

#### <a name="startDiscovery-method"> startDiscovery(*callback*)</a>

This method starts the discovery process and tries to find the Thunderboard React devices. Whenever a Thunderboard React device was found, the `callback` function specified to the 1st argument will be called.

When a device was found, the `callback` will be passed a [`ThunderboardReactDevice`](#ThunderboardReactDevice-object) object as the 1st argument. See the section "[`ThunderboardReactDevice` object](#ThunderboardReactDevice-object)" in details.

```JavaScript
var ThunderboardReact = require('node-thunderboard-react');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

thunder.init((error) => {
  // Discover the Thunderboard React Board Kit
  thunder.startDiscovery((device) => {
    console.log('- Found ' + device.localName);
    // Stop the discovery process
    thunder.stopDiscovery();
		// Do something with the device.
		// Generally, the device should be connected here.
  });
});
```

#### <a name="stopDiscovery-method"> stopDiscovery()</a>

This method stop the discovery process. If the `startDiscovery()` method was called and the targeted device was found, then be sure to call this method before controlling the targeted devices.

---------------------------------------
## <a name="ThunderboardReactDevice-object"> ThunderboardReactDevice object</a>

The `ThunderboardReactDevice` represents a Thunderboard React device. This object can be obtain through the discover process using the [`startDiscovery()`](#ThunderboardReact-startDiscovery-method) method on the [`ThunderboardReact`](#ThunderboardReact-object) object.

This section describes the methods implemented in the `ThunderboardReactDevice` object and the events fired on the `ThunderboardReactDevice` object.

### <a name="ThunderboardReactDevice-methods"> Methods</a>

#### <a name="connect-method"> connect(*[callback]*)</a>

This method tries to confirm a connection with the device which the `ThunderboardReactDevice` object represents. If the devcie was connected successfully, the `callback` specified as the 1st argument will be called. The `callback` is optional.

```JavaScript
// Create a ThunderboardReact object
var ThunderboardReact = require('../lib/node-thunderboard-react.js');
var thunder = new ThunderboardReact();

// Initialize the ThunderboardReact object
thunder.init((error) => {
  // Discover the Thunderboard React Board Kit
  thunder.startDiscovery((device) => {
    console.log('- Found ' + device.localName);
    // Stop the discovery process
    thunder.stopDiscovery();
    // Connect to the found device
    device.connect((error) => {
      console.log('- Connected ' + device.localName);
      // Do something with the device
			...
    });
  });
});
```

After the connection has been confirmed, you can interact with the device using a lot of methods implemented on the `ThunderboardReactDevice` object described blow.

#### <a name="disconnect-method"> disconnect(*[callback]*)</a>

This method disconnects the device. If the device was disconnected successfully, the `callback` will be called. The `callback` is optional. Once the connection is disabled, the method other than the [`connect`](#connect-method) method won't work any more. If you want to interact with the same device again, call the [`connect`](#connect-method) method again.

#### <a name="getManufacturerName-method"> getManufacturerName(*callback*)</a>

This method reads the Manufacturer Name from the device. When the process was completed, the `callback` will be called. The two arguments will be passed to the `callback`: the `Error` object and `Response` object. The `Response` object is a hash object having the properties as follows:

### <a name="ThunderboardReactDevice-events"> Events</a>

This section describes the events fired on the [`ThunderboardReactDevice`](#ThunderboardReact-object) object.

#### <a name="connect-event"> `connect` event</a>

The `connect` event is fired on the [`ThunderboardReactDevice`](#ThunderboardReact-object) object when the connection is established. You can listen to the `connect` event in order to know the timing when the connection is established without not specifying a callback to the [`connect()`](#connect-method).

```JavaScript
device.on('connect', () => {
  // Do something with the device
});
device.connect();
```

#### <a name="disconnect-event"> `disconnect` event</a>

The `disconnect` event is fired on the [`ThunderboardReactDevice`](#ThunderboardReact-object) object when the connection is closed whatever the reason.

The callback for the `disconnect` event is passed an `Event` object which is a hash object having the properties as follows:

Property   | Type    | Description
:----------|:--------|:-----------
`wasClean` | Boolean | This value represents the reason why the connection was closed. If the connection was closed by the `disconnect` method, this value is `true`. Otherwise, if the connection was closed by an unexpected reason, this value is `false`.

A BLE connection is often disconnected unexpectedly. Therefore, it is encouraged to listen to the `disconnect` event and prepare a recovery action.

```JavaScript
device.on('connect', () => {
  // Do something with the device
});

device.on('disconnect', (event) => {
	if(event.wasClean === false) { // Closed by an unexpected reason
    // Recovery action
  }
});
```
